### Something about me
Hi, my name is Anya, I am 23 years old. I am from town of the Slonim, Belarus. I am bunking specialist, I love my work, work with clever people and smart processes in bunking programs. But I feel it is not what I want to do (especially salary). I decided to *try* myself in IT and start with Front-end free course, which proposes by RSSchool. I promise myself work hard and study to finish school properly. My main goals are: to get skils enough fo future job and than get good salary. I study very fast and want to learn Java Script and other programming language clearly. I would be good web-developer./
